# Introduction
This is a simple streamlit app which perform sentiment analysis on a ficticious product review dataset. The sentiment analysis is performed using [bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment](https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment), a bert-based model from huggingface transformers library. It predicts the sentiment of the review as a number of stars (between 1 and 5). There is also a form, in case the user wants to input its own review.
### Questions
I wanted to answer 3 simple questions about the products:
* What are the percentages of five star reviews, four star reviews,etc?
* What are the top products based on average rating?
* What is the amount of five star reviews, four star reviews, etc. for each product?
